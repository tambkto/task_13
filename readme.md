**DEPLOYMENT ON ECS VIA JENKINS** 

This project creates ECS Cluster and EC2 via Terraform. Jenkins is configured on EC2 by following the Master Slave architecture. Jenkins Pipeline is created which deploys the application automatically over ECS. 

**Provision Infrastructure:** 

The terraform code for provisioning the ECS Cluster and EC2 is provided in the GitHub. We will provision an ECS Cluster on which the nginx official container would be deployed. 

**Terraform init:** 

This command will initializes the repository for creating infrastructure.
